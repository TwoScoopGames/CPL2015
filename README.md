A space ship shooter game built with plain 'ol JavaScript for a workshop at [Code PaLOUsa 2015](http://codepalousa.com). [The relevant slides are here.](http://ericlathrop.com/making-javascript-games/)

The master branch contains only images, and the step branches progress through more features as the number gets higher.
